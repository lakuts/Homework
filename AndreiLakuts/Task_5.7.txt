# Task 5.7*
# Run the module modules/mod_a.py. Check its result. Explain why does this happen.

Result:
>>>5

We imported the modules "mod_b.py" and "mod_c.py" into a module "mod_a.py".
As a result, the value from "mod_b.py" is used, because it was imported later.

# Try to change x to a list [1,2,3]. Explain the result.

Result:
>>>5

When we replaced the value of x with [1,2,3] in module "mod_c.py",
the result is still 5, because the value from "mod_b.py" is used

# Try to change import to from x import * where x - module names. Explain the result.

If "mod_a.py" is like this:
--------------------
from mod_c import *
from mod_b import *

print(mod_c.x)
--------------------

Result:
>>>5

the result is still 5, because the value "mod_c.x" imported from "mod_b.py".
