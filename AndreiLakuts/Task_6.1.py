# Task 6.1
# Implement a Counter class which optionally accepts the start value
# and the counter stop value. If the start value is not specified the
# counter should begin with 0. If the stop value is not specified it
# should be counting up infinitely.
# If the counter reaches the stop value, print "Maximal value is reached."
# Implement to methods: "increment" and "get"
# â€¢	If you are familiar with Exception rising use it to display the "Maximal value is reached." message.
# Example:
# >>> c = Counter(start=42)
# >>> c.increment()
# >>> c.get()
# 43
#
# >>> c = Counter()
# >>> c.increment()
# >>> c.get()
# 1
# >>> c.increment()
# >>> c.get()
# 2
#
# >>> c = Counter(start=42, stop=43)
# >>> c.increment()
# >>> c.get()
# 43
# >>> c.increment()
# Maximal value is reached.
# >>> c.get()
# 43
