# Task 5.3
# File data/students.csv stores information about students in CSV format.
# This file contains the studentâ€™s names, age and average mark.
# 2.	Implement a function which receives the file path with students info
# and writes CSV student information to the new file in descending order of age. Result:
# student name,age,average mark
# Verdell Crawford,30,8.86
# Brenda Silva,30,7.53
# ...
# Lindsey Cummings,18,6.88
# Raymond Soileau,18,7.27
